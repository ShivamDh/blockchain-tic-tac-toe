# Blockchain Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a small blockchain project I undertook to try and learn more about blockchain while building an application concurrently

### Purpose

It is meant to be a simple tic-tac-toe game but using some of blockchain's notable features to create a more secure and fascinating version of this game

### How it's created

The game is built using Angular as its front-end and built on top of a custom blockchain I developed myself
